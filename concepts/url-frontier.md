## URL Frontier in Web Crawling

### What is a URL Frontier?
- **Definition**: The URL Frontier is the component of a web crawler that manages the list or queue of URLs that are yet to be
visited and processed. It's essentially the crawler's 'to-do list'.
- **Function**: It decides the order and priority in which URLs are crawled, playing a crucial role in determining the
crawler's behavior and efficiency.

### Why is URL Frontier Used?
- **Efficiency and Order**: The URL Frontier ensures that the crawler operates systematically,
visiting URLs in a structured manner rather than randomly. This improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the crawling process.
- **Prioritization**: It allows for the implementation of policies to prioritize certain URLs over others,
which can be based on various factors like page importance, update frequency, or crawl frequency.
- **Politeness Policy Compliance**: By managing the rate and sequence of URL visits, the URL Frontier helps in adhering
to politeness policies, ensuring the crawler doesn't overwhelm web servers.
- **Distributed Crawling**: In large-scale crawlers, the URL Frontier is essential for coordinating distributed crawling efforts,
ensuring that multiple crawler instances work in harmony without redundant efforts.

### Components of a URL Frontier
1. **URL Queue**: Stores and manages the list of URLs scheduled for crawling. It might involve complex data structures
to efficiently handle the massive scale of URLs.
2. **Prioritization Module**: Determines the order in which URLs are to be crawled. This may involve algorithms that
consider factors like URL importance, freshness, or crawl frequency.
3. **Politeness Policy Enforcer**: Ensures that the crawling adheres to rules set forth in `robots.txt` files and respects
the crawl-delay directives to prevent server overload.
4. **Deduplication Checker**: Prevents the crawler from visiting the same URL multiple times.
This part checks if a URL is already crawled or scheduled to avoid redundancy.
5. **Domain Resolution Component**: Works alongside the DNS resolver, helping in managing and scheduling URLs based on
their domain names for distributed crawling.
6. **Crawl Frontier Database**: A storage component that maintains the state of crawled and to-be-crawled URLs,
often necessary for recovery and resumption of crawling activities after interruptions.
