## Domain Name System (DNS)

### What is DNS?
- **DNS Explained**: The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the phonebook of the internet.
It translates human-readable domain names (like `www.example.com`) into IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`) that computers
use to identify each other on the network.
- **Functionality**: When you enter a website URL in your browser, DNS servers take that domain name and translate it into an IP address,
allowing your browser to locate and access the website's server.

### Why is DNS Used in Systems?
- **Human-Friendly Addresses**: Without DNS, we would need to remember the IP addresses of every website we want to visit,
which is not practical. DNS allows us to use easy-to-remember domain names.
- **Load Distribution**: DNS can be used to manage traffic and distribute loads across multiple servers.
For high-traffic websites, DNS ensures that no single server gets overwhelmed by directing requests to different servers.
- **Redundancy and Failover**: In case of server downtime, DNS can direct traffic to another operational server,
increasing the system's reliability and uptime.
- **Scalability**: DNS allows for easy scaling of web services. As a system grows, additional servers can be added and
managed through DNS without affecting the end user's experience.
- **Security**: DNS can also contribute to security measures, like DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack mitigation,
by controlling and filtering incoming traffic.

## The Four Types of DNS Servers

### 1. DNS Recursor (Recursive Resolver)
- **Role**: Acts as a middleman between a client (like a web browser) and the DNS nameserver.
It receives queries from client machines through applications like web browsers.
- **Function**: The recursor is responsible for making additional requests to satisfy the client's DNS query.
It queries the various DNS nameservers on behalf of the client, starting with the root nameserver and moving down the hierarchy.
- **Key Characteristic**: It is designed for client-facing interactions, handling requests from user devices looking to resolve domain names to IP addresses.

### 2. Root Nameserver
- **Role**: The root server is the first step in translating (resolving) human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
- **Function**: It responds to requests for the top-level domain (TLD) nameserver information. Essentially, it serves as a reference to the TLD nameservers.
- **Key Characteristic**: There are 13 sets of root nameservers, identified by letters A through M, strategically placed around the world.
They are the highest-level DNS servers in the DNS hierarchy.

### 3. TLD Nameserver (Top-Level Domain Nameserver)
- **Role**: Hosts the last portion of a hostname (like `.com`, `.net`, or `.org`).
- **Function**: When a recursor queries a TLD nameserver, it responds with the IP address of the domain's authoritative nameserver.
- **Key Characteristic**: TLD nameservers are essential for the next step of the DNS lookup, providing the link to the domains under their respective TLDs.

### 4. Authoritative Nameserver
- **Role**: This is the final stop in the query process. It holds the actual DNS records (like A, AAAA, MX records).
- **Function**: When queried, it responds with the requested DNS record – the IP address for the requested domain.
- **Key Characteristic**: An authoritative nameserver is the definitive source for information about a domain. 
It can provide a recursive resolver with the final answer or tell it that it doesn’t exist.

### Components of DNS
- **Domain Names**: A human-readable address of a website or service (e.g., `www.example.com`).
- **IP Addresses**: A unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network.
- **Nameservers**: Servers that store the DNS records for domains.
- **DNS Records**: Entries that provide information about a domain, including IP addresses (A and AAAA records),
mail servers (MX records), and others.

## DNS Lookup: Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Step 1: User Initiates a Request
- **Action**: A user types a domain name (like `www.example.com`) into a web browser and hits enter.
- **Trigger**: This action triggers a DNS query, which begins the process of resolving the domain name into an IP address.

### Step 2: Contacting the Recursive Resolver
- **Action**: The user's device contacts a DNS recursor (or recursive resolver), typically provided by the user’s Internet Service Provider (ISP).
- **Role of Recursive Resolver**: Acts as the middleman between the user and the DNS nameservers. It receives the query
and begins the process of finding the correct IP address.

### Step 3: Querying the Root Nameserver
- **Action**: The recursive resolver forwards the query to a root nameserver.
- **Role of Root Nameserver**: Root nameservers are the top of the DNS hierarchy. They don’t know the IP address for the
domain but can direct the query to the appropriate TLD nameserver (like `.com`, `.net`, etc.).

### Step 4: Finding the TLD Nameserver
- **Action**: The recursive resolver then queries the TLD nameserver for the domain’s TLD (e.g., `.com` for `www.example.com`).
- **Role of TLD Nameserver**: Holds information about the authoritative nameservers for its particular TLD.
It doesn't know the specific IP address but knows where to find it.

### Step 5: Reaching the Authoritative Nameserver
- **Action**: The recursive resolver queries the authoritative nameserver.
- **Role of Authoritative Nameserver**: This server has the actual DNS record for the domain (like A or AAAA record),
which includes the IP address of the domain.

### Step 6: Retrieving the IP Address
- **Action**: The authoritative nameserver returns the IP address for the domain back to the recursive resolver.
- **Result**: Now, the recursive resolver knows the IP address associated with the domain name.

### Step 7: Delivering the Response to the User
- **Action**: The recursive resolver sends the IP address back to the user’s device.
- **Result**: The user's browser can now send an HTTP request to the IP address to access the website associated with the domain name.

### Step 8: Caching for Efficiency
- **Additional Step**: The resolved IP address is often cached at various points along the query path, including the user’s own system.
This caching reduces the need for subsequent queries for the same domain name.

### Types of DNS Queries
1. **Recursive Query**: A client requests a DNS resolver to get the complete answer to a query.
2. **Iterative Query**: The DNS resolver provides the best information it has, which might include the address of another
DNS server that can provide more details.

### DNS Caching
- **Purpose**: To speed up DNS queries by temporarily storing previous query results. It reduces the number of external queries required,
thereby decreasing response time.
- **Location**: Caching occurs at various levels, including the user's browser, the user's operating system, the resolver,
and other intermediate servers.

### Significance of DNS
- **User-Friendly Internet**: DNS makes the Internet user-friendly by allowing users to access websites using domain names instead of IP addresses.
- **Essential for Internet Functionality**: It is a fundamental building block of the Internet, enabling the functionality of email services,
web browsing, and other services that rely on networked connectivity.
- **Global Internet Traffic Management**: DNS plays a key role in managing the flow of Internet traffic, guiding requests to appropriate servers.
