# Designing a Rate Limiter

# Understanding the Problem: Scope and Requirements for Rate Limiter

Designing an effective rate limiter begins with a clear understanding of the problem,
establishing the scope, and defining specific requirements.

## 1. Identify the Purpose of the Rate Limiter

- **API Protection**: Is the rate limiter intended to protect APIs from being overwhelmed?
- **Resource Management**: Or is it to manage and allocate resources fairly among users?
- **Security Measures**: Is it part of a strategy to mitigate DDoS attacks?

## 2. Determine the Scope

- **System-Wide vs Service-Specific**: Is the rate limiter for the entire system or specific services?
- **Global vs User-Specific**: Should rate limiting apply globally across all users or vary for different user tiers?

## 3. Define Rate Limiting Criteria

- **By IP Address**: Limiting requests based on the requester's IP address.
- **By User Account**: Differentiating users based on account or API token.
- **By Endpoint**: Different limits for different parts of the application or API.

## 4. Establish Rate Limits

- **Limit Threshold**: Number of allowed requests in a given time frame (e.g., 1000 requests per minute).
- **Configurability**: Determine if the limits need to be dynamically configurable.

## 5. Response Strategy for Over-Limit Requests

- **HTTP Status Codes**: Decide on the response code (e.g., HTTP 429 Too Many Requests).
- **Informative Messages**: Include messages guiding users on how to proceed or when they can try again.

## 6. Considerations for Distributed Systems

- **Consistency**: Ensure rate limits are enforced consistently across all nodes in a distributed environment.
- **Synchronization**: Decide on strategies for syncing rate limit counters in a distributed setup.

By thoroughly understanding and defining these aspects, the foundation for designing a rate limiter that is tailored to
the specific needs of the system is set, ensuring effective control of traffic flow and resource utilization.

# High-Level Design for Rate Limiter

## System Overview

The rate limiter will serve as a critical component in controlling the flow of incoming requests to the system,
ensuring efficient resource utilization and preventing overloads.

## System Requirements

### 1. **Location in Architecture**
- The rate limiter will be positioned at the entry point of the system, such as a gateway or a proxy, to filter incoming requests.

### 2. **Scalability**
- It must be capable of handling a high volume of requests and scalable to accommodate growth in traffic.

### 3. **Performance**
- The rate limiting process should introduce minimal latency to the request processing pipeline.

### 4. **Consistency**
- In a distributed system, the rate limiter should maintain consistency across all nodes.

### 5. **Configurability**
- Allow dynamic configuration of rate limits to adapt to varying traffic patterns and requirements.

### 6. **Monitoring and Reporting**
- Integration with monitoring tools for real-time visibility into rate limiting metrics and alerts.

### 7. **Handling Excess Traffic**
- Mechanism to manage requests that exceed the rate limits, ensuring they are not lost and can be retried.


## High-Level Components

1. **Request Identification**: To identify and differentiate requests based on IP, user ID, or API token.
2. **Rate Limit Algorithm**: The core logic to determine whether to allow or block a request.
3. **Data Store/Cache**: To maintain the state, counts, or tokens for rate limiting (e.g., Redis).
4. **Data Store for Rate Limiting Rules**: Stores the rate limiting rules, allowing dynamic updates and retrieval.
5. **Cache Layer for Rules**: Caches the rate limiting rules for high-speed access, reducing latency.
A background worker updates the cache when rules in the data store change.
6. **Message Queue for Excess Traffic**: Captures and queues requests that exceed rate limits.
Allows for retrying or analyzing these requests at a later time.
7. **Logging and Monitoring**: Tracks rate limit hits, queue length, and system performance metrics.

## Integration of Message Queue

### Handling Rate-Limited Requests
- When a request is rate-limited, instead of outright rejection, it can be sent to a message queue.
- This queue can then be processed according to the system's capability, ensuring that requests are not lost and are handled in a fair manner.

### Use Cases for the Message Queue
- **Retrying**: The queued requests can be retried after a certain cooldown period.
- **Analysis**: Analyzing the queued requests can provide insights into traffic patterns and potential abuse scenarios.

## Dynamic Rule Adjustment Mechanism

### Updating Rules
- Rate limiting rules are stored in a central data store (e.g., a database).
- Administrators can update these rules as needed based on traffic patterns or system changes.

### Propagating Rule Updates
- A worker or listener service monitors for changes in the rules.
- Upon a change, it updates the cached rules used by the rate limiter.
- This ensures that the rate limiter always enforces the most current set of rules.

## Rate Limiting Algorithms

### 1. Fixed Window Counter
- **Use Case**: For systems with consistent and predictable traffic patterns.
- **Mechanism**: Uses a simple counter to track requests in a fixed time window.

### 2. Sliding Log Algorithm
- **Use Case**: When requests need to be evenly distributed over time.
- **Mechanism**: Maintains a log of timestamps of each request.

### 3. Token Bucket Algorithm
- **Use Case**: Effective for handling bursty traffic patterns.
- **Mechanism**: Provides tokens at a steady rate, which are consumed by incoming requests.

### 4. Leaky Bucket Algorithm
- **Use Case**: For ensuring a uniform rate of request processing.
- **Mechanism**: Requests fill a bucket and are processed at a steady leak rate.

### 5. Sliding Window Counter
- **Use Case**: Balancing between fixed window and sliding log, suitable for distributed systems.
- **Mechanism**: Adjusts counters based on the time elapsed in the current window.

The choice of algorithm depends on the specific needs and characteristics of the system, including traffic patterns,
resource constraints, and performance requirements. By carefully considering these factors,
the most suitable rate limiting approach can be selected to maintain system stability and efficiency.

## Key Considerations for Distributed Rate Limiting

### 1. **Consistency Across Nodes**
- Ensure that rate limiting rules and counters are consistent across all nodes.
- This might involve centralized data storage or distributed synchronization mechanisms.

### 2. **Scalability**
- The rate limiter should be able to scale horizontally as the number of nodes in the system increases.
- Consider load balancing strategies to evenly distribute requests across nodes.

### 3. **Data Synchronization**
- Implement efficient data synchronization methods to keep rate limiting counters updated across nodes.
- Technologies like distributed caches (e.g., Redis Cluster) can be utilized.

### 4. **High Availability and Fault Tolerance**
- The system should be resilient to node failures, with mechanisms to handle failover smoothly.
- Replication of rate limiting data can help in maintaining high availability.

### 5. **Latency Considerations**
- In a distributed setting, network latency can impact the effectiveness of rate limiting.
- Strategies to minimize network calls, such as local caching with periodic synchronization, can be beneficial.

## Strategies for Distributed Rate Limiting

### 1. **Centralized Data Store with Distributed Caching**
- Use a centralized database for storing rate limits while caching these limits locally on each node.
- Synchronize the local caches periodically to ensure consistency.

### 2. **Distributed Counters**
- Implement counters in a distributed manner, using technologies like CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types) or distributed databases.

### 3. **Stateless Design**
- Design the rate limiter in a way that does not rely on the state of individual nodes.
- Use strategies like hashing to determine which node handles which requests, ensuring even distribution.

### 4. **Queue-Based Approach for Handling Excess Traffic**
- Use distributed queues to manage requests that exceed rate limits.
- This approach allows for later processing or analysis of these requests in a distributed manner.
